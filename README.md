MLA.js

# Why another MLA Citation generator?

There are a few notable online citation-tools.
They all just work, but they come with disadvantages:
* They are closed-source.
* They are full of advertisements.
* They are performing a simple process in a complicated way.

Most people will simply want to cite web sites,
and web sites in MLA is not a complicated process.

It is incredible that students are required to cite
their sources in "MLA format",
and then are told to "go to EasyBib or Citationmachine".

These sites do not only good.
They are slow, unreliable, greedy.

I have personally had to regather sources fast, when EasyBib's
servers broke down once.

You don't deserve to be reliant on these services.


This is why I am creating MLA.js.
We *need* a open-source framework to gather citation data
and compete with commercial services.

# Critique

MLA sucks.
The format is not easily readable, and there is
no centrally accepted standard definition (apparently).
Everyone seems to have their own interpretation of it.
All I could find were unclear examples.

There is a book of the MLA association:
"MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing",
but it seems more like a manual than a clear standardization effort,
possibly explaining why there are so many different points of
view on the citation style.

See the following opinions:

However, this seems to be the clearest definition:

The public site of the "Modern Language Association"
seems very "modern". MLA is a organization, which got
stuck in time.

Their standards are aimed at traditional sources of information,
which have become highly uncommon in today's schools.

In my opinion,
`"PH." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, 26 Jan. 2014. Web. 29 Jan. 2014. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH>.`
is not a nice solution for referencing media on the web.

MLA is unordered. It does not seem to be clear if it is
acceptable to leave out elements.
Different sites deal with this problem differently.
This effectively makes the collection a unordered list.

Unordered data makes crawling and generating trees of citations
challenging for crawlers.

No document says that the URL has to be given.
Not specifying the URL would make most citations useless,
and should therefore be in the standard.
I have had teachers, which ask to "cite in MLA", and then
complain that there are no URLs.

We need a better standard for citations.
